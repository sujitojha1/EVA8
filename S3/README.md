# TSAI - EVA8 Session 3 Assignment

## Problem Statement

1. PART 1[250]: Rewrite the whole excel sheet showing backpropagation. Explain each major step, and write it on Github. 
        Use exactly the same values for all variables as used in the class
        Take a screenshot, and show that screenshot in the readme file
        The Excel file must be there for us to cross-check the image shown on readme (no image = no score)
        Explain each major step
        Show what happens to the error graph when you change the learning rate from [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0] 
        Upload all this to GitHub and then write all the above as part 1 of your README.md file. 
        Submit details to S4 - Assignment QnA. 
2. PART 2 [250]: We have considered many points in our last 4 lectures. Some of these we have covered directly and some indirectly. They are:
        How many layers,
        MaxPooling,
        1x1 Convolutions,
        3x3 Convolutions,
        Receptive Field,
        SoftMax,
        Learning Rate,
        Kernels and how do we decide the number of kernels?
        Batch Normalization,
        Image Normalization,
        Position of MaxPooling,
        Concept of Transition Layers,
        Position of Transition Layer,
        DropOut
        When do we introduce DropOut, or when do we know we have some overfitting
        The distance of MaxPooling from Prediction,
        The distance of Batch Normalization from Prediction,
        When do we stop convolutions and go ahead with a larger kernel or some other alternative (which we have not yet covered)
        How do we know our network is not going well, comparatively, very early
        Batch Size, and effects of batch size
        etc (you can add more if we missed it here)
3. Refer to this code: COLABLINK
        WRITE IT AGAIN SUCH THAT IT ACHIEVES
            99.4% validation accuracy
            Less than 20k Parameters
            You can use anything from above you want. 
            Less than 20 Epochs
            Have used BN, Dropout, a Fully connected layer, have used GAP. 
            To learn how to add different things we covered in this session, you can refer to this code: https://www.kaggle.com/enwei26/mnist-digits-pytorch-cnn-99 DONT COPY ARCHITECTURE, JUST LEARN HOW TO INTEGRATE THINGS LIKE DROPOUT, BATCHNORM, ETC.
4. This is a slightly time-consuming assignment, please make sure you start early. You are going to spend a lot of effort into running the programs multiple times
5. Once you are done, submit your results in S4-Assignment-Solution
6. You must upload your assignment to a public GitHub Repository. Create a folder called S4 in it, and add your iPynb code to it. THE LOGS MUST BE VISIBLE. Before adding the link to the submission make sure you have opened the file in an "incognito" window. 
7. If you misrepresent your answers, you will be awarded -100% of the score.
8. If you submit Colab Link instead of notebook uploaded on GitHub or redirect the GitHub page to colab, you will be awarded -50%
9. Submit details to S4 - Assignment QnA.
